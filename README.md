Source Files for a short and simple game I made in 2015. (Game was made using Gamemaker Studio)  
  
This game has also been uploaded to the Steam Gamemaker Studio Workshop

I also made a short YouTube video on it as well.

As I am uploading this in 2017, this game really isn't that impressive but shows a short project I had fun with in high school. And that's what matters right? :)
